    <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is Http ?</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is HTTP/1.1 ?</h2>
    <p> For better understanding, let’s assume the situation when you make a request to the server for the GUVI.html page & server responds to you as a resource GUVI.html page. before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server. again you make a request to the server for image img.jpg & the server gives a response as an image img.jpg. the connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. there is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection. These are the drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2: The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is HTTP/2 ?</h2>
    <p>HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format. it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.</p>

   <h2>Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>S.No</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.</td>
            <td>It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages</td>

            <td>4.</td>
            <td>It compresses data by itself.</td>

    <h1>Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).</p>
    <p>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
        An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.</p>
        <p>Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
        <p>For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like <code> updateAddress, updateNam,</code> etc.</p>
        <h2>Objects and properties</h2>
        <p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:</p>
        <div><code>objectName.propertyName</code></div>
        <p>Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named <code>myCar </code>and give it properties named <code> make, model,</code> and <code>year</code> as follows:</p>
        <div><code>var myCar = new Object();<br>
            myCar.make = 'Ford';<br>
            myCar.model = 'Mustang';<br>
            myCar.year = 1969;</code></div>

    <h2>Creating Objects In JavaScript :</h2>
    <h2>Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal</h2>
    <p>One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below</p>
    <div><code>let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};</code></div>
    <h2>Create JavaScript Object with Constructor</h2>
    <p>Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below </p>
    <div><code>function Vehicle(name, maker) { <br>
        this.name = name; <br>
        this.maker = maker; <br>
     } <br>
     let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’); <br>
     let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’) <br>
     console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta <br>
     console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe</code></div>
     

        <h2>Using the JavaScript Keyword new</h2>
        <p>The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

           <br> <br>Example</p>
           <div><code>var person = new Object();<br>
            person.firstName = “John”;<br>
            person.lastName = “Doe”;<br>
            person.age = 50;<br>
            person.eyeColor = “blue”;</code></div>

            <h2>Using the <code style="font-size: x-large;"> Object.create </code> method</h2>
            <p>Objects can also be created using the <code> Object.create() </code> method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.</p>
            <div><code>  // Animal properties and method encapsulation <br>
                var Animal = {<br>
                  type: 'Invertebrates',     // Default value of properties <br>
                  displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal <br>
                    console.log(this.type);<br>
                  }<br>
                };<br>
                // Create new animal type called animal1 <br>
                var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);<br>
                animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates<br>
                // Create new animal type called Fishes<br>
                var fish = Object.create(Animal);<br>
                fish.type = 'Fishes';<br>
                fish.displayType(); <br>
                // Output:Fishes</code></div>

            <script>
                // Create object using constructor
                function Vehicle(Make,Model,Year) {
                    this.Make = Make;
                    this.Model = Model;
                    this.Year = Year;
                }
                let car1 = new Vehicle ("Tata","Indica","2001")
                let car2 = new Vehicle ("Nisson","Sentra","2021")
                console.log (car1);
                console.log (car2);
                
                // Create object using new keyword
                var person = new Object();
                person.firstName ="John"
                person.lastName = "Doe"

                console.log (person);

                // Create object using object.create 
            

                </script>

                <h2>What is IP Address ?</h2>
    <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is the logical address of our network hardware by which other devices identify it in a network. IP address stands for Internet Protocol address which is an unique number or a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network. Each device that is connected to internet an IP address is assigned to it for its unique identification. </p>
    <p>Addresses in IPv4 are 32-bits long example, <br><br>
 

        <code>12.244.233.165 </code> <br><br>
        And Addresses in IPv6 are 128-bits example, <br><br>
         
        
        <code>2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879 </code></p>
        <hr>
    <h2> What is Port Address ?</h2>
    <p>Port number is the part of the addressing information used to identify the senders and receivers of messages in computer networking. Different port numbers are used to determine what protocol incoming traffic should be directed to. Port number identifies a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. Ports are identified for each protocol and It is considered as a communication endpoint. </p>
    Ports are represented by 16-bit numbers. There are 2^16 port numbers i.e 65536. <br>
    They are divided into three categories <br>

    <h3>1. Well-Known Port Numbers</h3>
    0 to 1023 are well-known port numbers are as they are used by well-known protocol services.
    These are allocated to server services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

    <h3>2. Registered Port Numbers</h3>
    1024 to 49151 are registered port numbers i.e it can be registered to specific protocols by software corporations.
    
    <h3>3. Dynamic Port Numbers</h3>
    49152 to 65535 are dynamic port numbers and they can be used by anyone.

    <h2>HTTP request methods</h2>
    <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>

    <h4> <code>GET </code></h4>
    <p>The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.</p>
   <h4> <code>HEAD</code></h4> 
    <p>The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.</p>
    
    <h4><code>POST</code></h4>
   <p>The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</p> 
    
   <h4><code>PUT </code></h4> 
    <p>The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.</p>
    
    <h4><code>DELETE </code> </h4>
    <p>The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>CONNECT</code></h4>
    <p>The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>OPTIONS</code></h4>
    <p>The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>TRACE</code></h4>
    <p>The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>PATCH</code></h4>
    <p>The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.</p>

    <h2>What is MAC Address ?</h2>
    <p>MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet.</p>

<p>It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).</p>
<p>It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.</p>
<p>It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific.</p>
<p>It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.</p>
<p>It is provided by the device's vendor at the time of manufacturing and embedded in its NIC, which is ideally cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The ARP protocol is used to associate a logical address with a physical or MAC address.</p>
