    <h2>What is IP Address ?</h2>
    <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is the logical address of our network hardware by which other devices identify it in a network. IP address stands for Internet Protocol address which is an unique number or a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network. Each device that is connected to internet an IP address is assigned to it for its unique identification. </p>
    <p>Addresses in IPv4 are 32-bits long example, <br><br>
 

        <code>12.244.233.165 </code> <br><br>
        And Addresses in IPv6 are 128-bits example, <br><br>
         
        
        <code>2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879 </code></p>

    <h2> What is Port Address ?</h2>
    <p>Port number is the part of the addressing information used to identify the senders and receivers of messages in computer networking. Different port numbers are used to determine what protocol incoming traffic should be directed to. Port number identifies a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. Ports are identified for each protocol and It is considered as a communication endpoint. </p>
    Ports are represented by 16-bit numbers. There are 2^16 port numbers i.e 65536. <br>
    They are divided into three categories <br>

    <h3>1. Well-Known Port Numbers</h3>
    0 to 1023 are well-known port numbers are as they are used by well-known protocol services.
    These are allocated to server services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

    <h3>2. Registered Port Numbers</h3>
    1024 to 49151 are registered port numbers i.e it can be registered to specific protocols by software corporations.
    
    <h3>3. Dynamic Port Numbers</h3>
    49152 to 65535 are dynamic port numbers and they can be used by anyone.

    <h2>HTTP request methods</h2>
    <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>

    <h4> <code>GET </code></h4>
    <p>The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.</p>
   <h4> <code>HEAD</code></h4> 
    <p>The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.</p>
    
    <h4><code>POST</code></h4>
   <p>The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</p> 
    
   <h4><code>PUT </code></h4> 
    <p>The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.</p>
    
    <h4><code>DELETE </code> </h4>
    <p>The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>CONNECT</code></h4>
    <p>The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>OPTIONS</code></h4>
    <p>The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>TRACE</code></h4>
    <p>The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</p>
    
    <h4><code>PATCH</code></h4>
    <p>The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.</p>

    <h2>What is MAC Address ?</h2>
    <p>MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet.</p>

<p>It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).</p>
<p>It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.</p>
<p>It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific.</p>
<p>It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.</p>
<p>It is provided by the device's vendor at the time of manufacturing and embedded in its NIC, which is ideally cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The ARP protocol is used to associate a logical address with a physical or MAC address.</p>
